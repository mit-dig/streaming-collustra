## About

Collustra is a web-based environment for exploring SPARQL-enabled
triple stores. It uses standards endorsed by the W3C, including the
Resource Description Framework (RDF), the RDF Schema (RDFS), and the
Web Ontology Language (OWL) for interacting with class and property
descriptions. Queries are modelled using the SPARQL Inference Notation
(SPIN) and are executed using the SPARQL Protocol and RDF Query
Language (SPARQL).
